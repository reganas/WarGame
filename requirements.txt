### **Game Requirements**

#### **1. Players**

- The game typically has **two players**, but you could design it to support more if desired.

#### **2. Deck Setup**

- Use a **standard 52-card deck**, where each card has:
    
    - A rank (e.g., `2-10`, `J`, `Q`, `K`, `A`).
        
    - A suit (e.g., `hearts`, `diamonds`, `clubs`, `spades`).
        
- Cards should have a **value** assigned to ranks for comparison purposes (e.g., Ace = highest).
    
#### **3. Dealing the Cards**

- Shuffle the deck and **deal cards evenly** to both players. Each player starts with their own pile of cards.
    
#### **4. Gameplay**

- The game is played in **rounds**:
    
    1. Both players draw the top card from their piles.
        
    2. Compare the values of the two cards:
        
        - **Higher value wins**: The player with the higher card takes both cards and places them at the bottom of their pile.
            
        - **Tie** (war): If both cards have the same value:
            
            - Each player places three cards face-down and one card face-up (if they have enough cards). The face-up cards are compared.
                
            - The winner of the war takes all the cards.
                
            - If there's another tie, repeat the process until thereâ€™s a winner or a player runs out of cards.
                
    3. Players continue drawing cards until one player runs out of cards, losing the game.
        

#### **5. Winning the Game**

- The game ends when one player has all the cards or another termination condition (like a maximum number of rounds).
    

### **Additional Features (Optional)**

- **Enhance the Gameplay**:
    
    - Add the ability to track the number of rounds played.
        
    - Detect and handle infinite games (loops due to repeating card configurations).
        
    - Print/log the cards played in each round and the winner.
        
    - Add user input for decisions, such as whether to continue the game after a certain number of rounds.
        
- **Visualize the Game**:
    
    - Display the cards in a more user-friendly way (e.g., `5 of Hearts`).
        
    - Use a library like `pygame` for a graphical interface (optional).
        
- **Improve Randomization**:
    
    - Use Python's `random.shuffle()` to ensure the deck is shuffled before dealing.
        
- **Error Handling**:
    
    - Ensure the game handles edge cases, such as a player running out of cards during a war.
        

### **Technical Requirements**

1. **Language/Tools**:
    
    - Use **Python 3.x**.
        
    - Leverage built-in libraries like `random` for shuffling.
        
2. **Classes/Objects**:
    
    - A `Card` class to represent individual cards (rank, suit).
        
    - A `Deck` class to manage the deck (shuffle, deal).
        
    - A `Player` class to manage each player's pile of cards.
        
    - A `Game` class to handle the overall flow of the game.
        
3. **Data Structures**:
    
    - Use a list to represent the card pile for each player.
        
    - Append cards to the bottom and pop from the top of the list.
