### **Game Requirements**

#### **1. Players**

- The game has **two players**.

#### **2. Deck Setup**

- Use a **standard 52-card deck**, where each card has:
    
    - A rank (e.g., `2-10`, `J`, `Q`, `K`, `A`).
        
    - A suit (e.g., `hearts`, `diamonds`, `clubs`, `spades`).
        
- Cards should have a **value** assigned to ranks for comparison purposes (e.g., Ace = highest).
    
#### **3. Dealing the Cards**

- Shuffle the deck and **deal cards evenly** to both players. Each player starts with their own pile of cards.
    
#### **4. Gameplay**

- The game is played in **rounds**:
    
    1. Both players draw the top card from their piles.
        
    2. Compare the values of the two cards:
        
        - **Higher value wins**: The player with the higher card takes both cards and places them at the bottom of their pile.
            
        - **Tie** (war): If both cards have the same value:
            
            - Each player places three cards face-down and one card face-up (if they have enough cards). The face-up cards are compared.
                
            - The winner of the war takes all the cards.
                
            - If there's another tie, repeat the process until thereâ€™s a winner or a player runs out of cards.
                
    3. Players continue drawing cards until one player runs out of cards, losing the game.
        

#### **5. Winning the Game**

- The game ends when one player has all the cards or another termination condition (like a maximum number of rounds).
